# PRODIGY_DS_03
 This project involves the use of a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data from the Bank Marketing dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA process involves the following steps:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
- Data Visualization: Generating various plots to visualize the data distribution and relationships.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to improve the analysis.

## Key Findings
- Age Distribution: Understanding the age distribution of the customers.
- Job Distribution: Analyzing the job types of customers.
- Marital Status: Examining the impact of marital status on product purchase.
- Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between different features.

## Modeling
The modeling process involves training a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service.

### Steps:
1. Data Preparation: Splitting the data into training and test sets.
2. Model Training: Training the Decision Tree Classifier on the training data.
3. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
### Key Features
- Age: Customer's age.
- Job: Type of job.
- Marital Status: Marital status of the customer.
- Education: Level of education.
- Default: Whether the customer has credit in default.
- Balance: Average yearly balance.
- Housing: Whether the customer has a housing loan.
- Loan: Whether the customer has a personal loan.

## Results
- Model Performance: The Decision Tree Classifier achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set.
- Important Features: The most important features influencing the prediction were age, job type, and average yearly balance.
